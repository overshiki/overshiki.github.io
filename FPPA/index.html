<p>Why are there so many programming languages, like <code>C&#43;&#43;</code>, <code>python</code>, <code>Julia</code>, <code>Haskell</code>? Why <code>C</code> or <code>Fortran</code> is not enough for people in the field of scientific computing? Why <code>OOP</code> or <code>FP</code>? The reason is obviously simple: the way computer thinks is totally different from the way &#40;mathematical minding&#41; human-being thinks. For computers, state-machine or also called Turing machine is the main engine of thinking. Because of this, just a lot of details emerges: the memory limit, variables representing the current states, functions representing the operation on the states, and so on. There are even more details to be considered, when people care about the performance. However, the way a mathematical minding man/woman thinks is totally different, it is actually a combination of operations. For example, when we teach others to cook, what we are always saying is: Do this, do that, and then do that ... From mathematical point of view, what an algorithm is? Just formulas&#33; Formulas just declare something, using the composition of other formulas. However, when programming, we always need to translate the formula into a state-machine, that is troublesome.</p>
<p>People may struggle on the balance between the programming minding and the mathematical minding, just as what I am suffering from. Here in this post, I will show that how functional programming could help me avoid such suffer as much as possible. Actually, <code>FP</code> allows me to mathematically understand and practically program some algorithms/mathematical definition at the same level of abstract, that is amazing&#33;</p>
<p>The first example I present here is the definition of <code>tensor</code>. As you may know, the tensor is actually a multilinear function. In more details, it means it has several arguments&#40;slots&#41;, and output a value, the function is linear in each of its arguments. For example, the two-dimensional tensor could be defined in this way:</p>
\[T(v + cw) = T(v) + cT(w) \forall c\]
\[T(cv + w) = cT(v) + T(w) \forall c\]
<p>When the arguments/variables is in a discrete set of values, the tensor will become the form what we normally know: the multidimensional array. </p>
<p>The <code>N</code>-dimensional array just contains all the possible outcomes given all possible combination of income arguments of a <code>N</code>-dimensional tensor. </p>
